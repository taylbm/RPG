			"Parameters": [
				"Short pulse (1.57us; PRF 318 to 1304 Hz)",
				"Unambiguous (Nyquist) velocity range 21 to 32 m/2 (41.5 to 62.5 knots)",
				"Nine elevation angles",
				"Seven-minute update rate",
				"Velocity data within 300 km (161 nm) radius",
				"Hydrometeorological data within 230 km (124 nm) radius",
				"Reflectivity data within 460 km (248 nm) radius",
				"Separate surveillance and Dopper scans are taken at the three lowest elevation angles to improve clutter filtering performance, maximize the velocity accuracy and unambiguous interval",
				"SZ-2 Duppler processing for all three Split Cuts",
				"All elevation angles are contiguous or overlap"
			],
			"Strengths/Applications": [
				"Uses standard elevation set which result in seamless looping with precipitation mode VCPs",
				"SZ-2 Doppler processing significantly reduces range-folded velocity data",
				"Low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) provides increased data coverage",
				"Long azimuthal dwell times result in very good moment estimate standard deviation",
				"Provides overlapping elevation coverage for the lowest levels of the atmosphere",
				"Six elevation scans below 4&deg; (overlapping beam sampling)",
				"Very good rainfall and snowfall estimates due to increased low-level scanning"
			],
			"Limitations": [
				"Somewhat less sensitive than VCP 31",
